# Libft - @42Born2Code
My implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions including some additional ones.

## What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.
